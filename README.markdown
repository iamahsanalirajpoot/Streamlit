# Streamlit Learning Repository

Welcome to the Streamlit Learning Repository! This repository contains detailed notes and example code for learning [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a powerful Python library for creating interactive web applications, particularly for data science and machine learning projects. The content is primarily documented in two Jupyter Notebooks: `streamlit_basics.ipynb` and `streamlit_docs.ipynb`, with additional example code files stored in the `example_code_files` directory.


## Repository Overview

1. **streamlit_basics.ipynb**: An introduction to Streamlit's core components, including UI elements, user input widgets, media components, layout structuring, interactivity, and data visualization. It also includes two challenges to apply the concepts learned.
2. **streamlit_docs.ipynb**: A deeper dive into Streamlit's API reference, focusing on key features like `st.write()` and magic commands, with references to additional example code files.

The `example_code_files` directory contains Python scripts referenced in the notebooks, demonstrating specific Streamlit functionalities.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
- Additional libraries (used in examples):
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `plotly` 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash

   cd Streamlit
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib plotly
   ```

3. Verify Streamlit installation by running the demo app:
   ```bash
   streamlit hello
   ```
